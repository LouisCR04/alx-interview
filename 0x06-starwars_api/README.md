## STAR WARS API

A script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:


1. The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID - example: 3 = “Return of the Jedi”
2. Displays one character name per line in the same order as the “characters” list in the /films/ endpoint
3. Uses the Star wars API
4. Uses the request module
